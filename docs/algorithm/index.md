# 把学习算法当成 mental workout

At this stage of my career, I can't use the same old mentality when it comes
to coding practice.

Old mentality:

* spend tons of time and energy
* felt exhausted and can't feel the joy of coding

New mentality:

* use it as a way to get yourself familiar with the new language
* be fluent at the basic grammar and syntax and be more productive
