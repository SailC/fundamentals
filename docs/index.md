# ICP content demos

This repo contains a set of demo apps to show how to leverage ICP design pattern to build application contents. For more information, please refer to [ICP Content Provider Playbook]([http://icp-content-playbook.rch.stglabs.ibm.com/](http://icp-content-playbook.rch.stglabs.ibm.com/))
