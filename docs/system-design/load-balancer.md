Load balancers distribute incoming client requests to computing resources such as application servers and databases.  In each case, the load balancer returns the response from the computing resource to the appropriate client.  Load balancers are effective at:

* Preventing requests from going to unhealthy servers
* Preventing overloading resources
* Helping eliminate single points of failure

Load balancers can be implemented with hardware (expensive) or with software such as HAProxy.

Additional benefits include:

* **SSL termination** - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations
    * Removes the need to install [X.509 certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) on each server
* **Session persistence** - Issue cookies and route a specific client's requests to same instance if the web apps do not keep track of sessions

> Cookies can store the address of the server so the next the user visit the website, he goes to the same back-end server. Downside: the private IP of the back-end server may change; the private IP is now visible to the whole world. Instead, we can store a big random number in the cookie and let load balancer work on how to translate that number to the backend server.

To protect against failures, it's common to set up multiple load balancers, either in [active-passive](#active-passive) or [active-active](#active-active) mode.

Load balancers can route traffic based on various metrics, including:

* Random
* Least loaded
* Session/cookies
* [Round robin or weighted round robin](http://g33kinfo.com/info/archives/2657)

### Layer 4 vs 7 load balancing

Layer 4 load balancers look at info at the [transport layer](#communication) to decide how to distribute requests.  Generally, this involves the source, destination IP addresses, and ports in the header, but not the contents of the packet.  When the Layer 4 load balancer receives a request and makes the load balancing decision, it also performs Network Address Translation (NAT) on the request packet, changing the recorded destination IP address from its own to that of the content server it has chosen on the internal network. Similarly, before forwarding server responses to clients, the load balancer changes the source address recorded in the packet header from the serverâ€™s IP address to its own. (The destination and source TCP port numbers recorded in the packets are sometimes also changed in a similar way.)

Layer 7 load balancers look at the [application layer](#communication) to decide how to distribute requests.  This can involve contents of the header, message, and cookies.  Layer 7 load balancers terminates network traffic, reads the message, makes a load-balancing decision, then opens a connection to the selected server.  For example, a layer 7 load balancer can direct video traffic to servers that host videos while directing more sensitive user billing traffic to security-hardened servers.

At the cost of flexibility, layer 4 load balancing requires less time and computing resources than Layer 7, although the performance impact can be minimal on modern commodity hardware.

Modern general-purpose load balancers, such as NGINX Plus and the open source NGINX software, generally operate at Layer 7 and serve as full reverse proxies. Rather than manage traffic on a packet-by-packet basis like Layer 4 load balancers that use NAT, Layer 7 load balancing proxies can read requests and responses in their entirety. They manage and manipulate traffic based on a full understanding of the transaction between the client and the application server.

### Disadvantage(s): load balancer

* The load balancer can become a performance bottleneck if it does not have enough resources or if it is not configured properly.
* Introducing a load balancer to help eliminate single points of failure results in increased complexity.
* A single load balancer is a single point of failure, configuring multiple load balancers further increases complexity.

## Reverse proxy (web server)

A reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public.  Requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the server's response to the client.

Additional benefits include:

* **Increased security** - Hide information about backend servers, blacklist IPs, limit number of connections per client
* **Increased scalability and flexibility** - Clients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration
* **SSL termination** - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations
    * Removes the need to install [X.509 certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) on each server
* **Compression** - Compress server responses
* **Caching** - Return the response for cached requests
* **Static content** - Serve static content directly
    * HTML/CSS/JS
    * Photos
    * Videos
    * Etc

### Load balancer vs reverse proxy

* Deploying a load balancer is useful when you have multiple servers.  Often, load balancers  route traffic to a set of servers serving the same function.
* Reverse proxies can be useful even with just one web server or application server, opening up the benefits described in the previous section.
* Solutions such as NGINX and HAProxy can support both layer 7 reverse proxying and load balancing.

### Disadvantage(s): reverse proxy

* Introducing a reverse proxy results in increased complexity.
* A single reverse proxy is a single point of failure, configuring multiple reverse proxies (ie a [failover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failover)) further increases complexity.
