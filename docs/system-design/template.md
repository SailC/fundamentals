## Step 1: Outline use cases and constraints

### Use cases (ask interviewer)

* **User** makes a read or write request
    * **Service** does processing, stores user data, then returns the results
* **Service** needs to evolve from serving a small amount of users to millions of users
    * Discuss general scaling patterns as we evolve an architecture to handle a large number of users and requests
* **Service** has high availability

### Constraints

### Load parameters

* [handy conversion](back-of-env/#handy-conversion-guide)

## Step 2: Create a high level design

> Outline a high level design with all important components.

---

## Step 3: Design core components

> Dive into details for each core component.

### Use case:

---

## Step 4: Scale the design

> Identify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.
#### Motivation

#### How to scale
