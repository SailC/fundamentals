## Reliability
Reliability means making system work correctly, even when faults occur. Fautls can be in hardware, software or human. Fault-tolerance techniques can hide certain types of faults from the end users.

## Scalability
Scalability keeps good performance even when load increases. In order to discuss scalability, we first need ways to describe load & performance quantitively.
- e.g. twitter home timeline
In a scalable system, you can add processing capacity in order to remain reliable under high load.

## Maintainability
It's about making life better for the engineering & operation teams. Good abstractions help reduce complexity & make the system easier to modify & adapt for new use cases. Good operability means having good visibility into the system's health, and having effective ways of managing it.
